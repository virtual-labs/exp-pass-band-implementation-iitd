<p>Digital modulation schemes are techniques used to encode information into a carrier signal by varying its properties according to discrete signal levels or symbols. Hereâ€™s an overview of three common digital modulation schemes: Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), and Phase Shift Keying (PSK). <b>Amplitude shift keying (ASK)</b> is the simplest digital modulation technique. In this modulation method there is only one carrier which is switched ON/OFF depending upon the input binary sequence to transmit symbol 0 and 1. The binary ASK system was one of the earliest form of digital modulation used in wireless telegraphy. For <b>frequency shift keying (FSK)</b>, two binary values are represented by two
different frequencies. For example, We choose two carrier frequencies, f1 and f2, and f1 > f2. Then we modulate binary bit "1" with f1 and binary "0" with f2 frequency, which is a lower frequency than f1. In <b>phase shift keying (PSK)</b>, here,e the carrier signal phase is with a modulated signal with the phase
related to the last bit for binary "1," and binary "0" is sent with a signal with the
same phase as the preceding one. For example, whenever we need to transmit
binary "1", we change the signal's phase by 180 degree, but the phase remains the
same when we transmit binary "0". Each modulation scheme has its advantages and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the communication system, such as bandwidth, power efficiency, and noise resilience.</p>
