		            <p class="mb-4">
Amplitude shift keying (ASK) is the simplest digital modulation technique. In this modulation method there is only one carrier which is switched ON/OFF depending upon the input binary sequence to transmit symbol 0 and 1. The binary ASK system was one of the earliest form of digital modulation used in wireless telegraphy. In an binary ASK system binary symbol 1 is represented by transmitting a sinusoidal carrier wave of fixed amplitude Ac and fixed frequency fc for the bit duration Tb where as binary symbol 0 is represented by switching of the carrier for Tb seconds. This signal can be generated simply by turning the carrier of a sinusoidal oscillator ON and OFF for the prescribed periods indicated by the modulating pulse train. For this reason the scheme is also known as on-off shift testing. The ASK signal can be generated by applying the incoming binary data and the sinusoidal carrier to the two inputs of a product modulator. The resulting output is the ASK wave.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            In this modulation, binary 1 is represented by the presence of a
            carrier and binary 0 by the absence of a carrier.

		            <p class="mb-4">
For Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK), binary bit '0' can be represented as lower level voltage and bit '1' as higher level voltage. For example, you can map binary bit '0' to 0 and bit '1' to 5 volts. Then, you can transmit the signal to the wire to the destination.

The digital binary information modulates the amplitude of a sinusoidal carrier signal at a higher frequency (fc​). Amplitude is varied to represent binary data, but the signal oscillates at the carrier frequency.

          </h3>
          <p class="pl-8">
            Let's explore ASK modulation under two common noise scenarios: AWGN
            (Additive White Gaussian Noise) and Rayleigh fading.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-[24px] font-semibold text-black pl-8">
            ASK Modulation with AWGN:
          </h4>
          <p class="pl-8">
            We've already discussed the effect of AWGN on ASK modulation in the
            previous response. The mathematical effect involves adding
            Gaussian-distributed noise to the modulated signal. The received
            signal y(t) is given by: <br />
            y(t) = x(t) + n(t) <br />
            Where: <br />
            x(t) is the modulated ASK signal. <br />
            n(t) is the AWGN. <br />
            The effect of AWGN is to add random variations to the amplitude of
            the signal, which can lead to erroneous detection of the transmitted
            symbols. The SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) plays a crucial role in
            determining the quality of demodulation, with higher SNR values
            leading to better performance. <br />
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-[24px] font-semibold text-black pl-8">
            ASK Modulation with Rayleigh Fading:
          </h4>
          <p class="pl-8">
            Rayleigh fading is a type of multipath fading that occurs in
            wireless communication channels. It's characterized by a random
            variation in the amplitude of the received signal due to
            constructive and destructive interference of multiple signal paths.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mathematically, Rayleigh fading can be represented as a complex
            Gaussian random variable with zero mean and a certain variance. The
            received signal y(t) in the presence of Rayleigh fading can be
            represented as: <br />
            y(t) = h . x(t) + n(t) <br />
            Where: <br />

            h is the complex fading coefficient, representing the channel gain
            and phase shift. <br />
            x(t) is the modulated ASK signal. <br />
            n(t) is the noise <br />
            <br />
            The fading coefficient h introduces random amplitude and phase
            variations to the signal. Due to the randomness of h, the received
            signal's amplitude will experience fluctuations, impacting the
            detection of transmitted symbols. The actual fading distribution
            might vary depending on the specific channel characteristics. <br />
            <br />

            When ASK modulation is subjected to different noise configurations,
            the mathematical representation of the received signal changes.
            Under AWGN, Gaussian noise is added to the signal's amplitude. Under
            Rayleigh fading, the complex fading coefficient introduces random
            amplitude and phase variations. The performance of ASK modulation in
            these scenarios depends on the SNR for AWGN and the characteristics
            of the fading channel for Rayleigh fading.

            c. Under Different Scenarios
          </h3>
          <p class="pl-8">
            Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a modulation technique that varies
            the amplitude of a carrier signal to convey digital information. The
            behavior of ASK modulation can vary in different scenarios based on
            factors like noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and channel
            characteristics. <br />
            <br />

            <span class="font-semibold">Low Noise Environment: </span> <br />
            In a scenario with low noise and a high SNR, ASK modulation tends to
            perform well. The transmitted signal's amplitude variations are
            accurately detected at the receiver, resulting in reliable data
            transmission. The demodulator can easily distinguish between the
            different amplitude levels, leading to low error rates. <br />
            <br />

            <span class="font-semibold">High Noise Environment:</span> <br />
            In the presence of high noise levels, ASK modulation can become less
            reliable. The noise can lead to amplitude fluctuations in the
            received signal, making it challenging for the receiver to
            accurately detect the intended amplitude levels. This can result in
            higher bit error rates and decreased communication reliability
            compared to scenarios with lower noise levels. <br />
            <br />

            <span class="font-semibold">Multi-Path Fading Channels: </span
            ><br />
            In scenarios with multi-path fading channels, where the transmitted
            signal takes multiple paths due to reflections and scattering, ASK
            modulation might experience fading. Fading can lead to rapid changes
            in signal amplitude at the receiver, causing difficulties in
            demodulation. To combat fading, techniques like diversity reception
            and error correction coding can be employed.<br />
            <br />

            <span class="font-semibold">Frequency Selective Channels: </span
            ><br />
            ASK modulation can be affected by frequency-selective channels,
            where certain frequency components of the signal experience more
            attenuation than others. This can result in distortion of the
            amplitude-modulated signal, leading to errors in detection at the
            receiver.<br />
            <br />

            <span class="font-semibold"> Varying Signal Amplitude:</span><br />
            ASK modulation relies on varying the carrier signal's amplitude. If
            the transmitted signal encounters amplifiers or attenuators along
            its path, the modulation depth can change, affecting the ability to
            accurately detect the signal's amplitude variations at the
            receiver.<br />
            <br />

            <span class="font-semibold"> Adaptive Modulation:</span><br />
            In some scenarios, adaptive modulation techniques can be used with
            ASK. This involves dynamically changing the modulation depth or
            constellation points based on the changing channel conditions. In
            good channel conditions, higher modulation levels (larger
            constellation points) can be used for increased data rates, while in
            poor conditions, lower modulation levels can be employed for better
            reliability.<br />
            <br />

            <span class="font-semibold"> Error Correction Coding:</span><br />
            To improve ASK modulation's performance in noisy environments, error
            correction codes can be employed. These codes add redundancy to the
            transmitted data, allowing the receiver to correct errors that might
            have occurred during transmission. This is particularly useful in
            scenarios where ASK modulation alone might result in unacceptably
            high error rates.<br />
            <br />

            In summary, ASK modulation's performance is influenced by noise,
            channel characteristics, and modulation depth. While ASK is
            straightforward to implement, it might not be as robust as other
            modulation techniques like Phase Shift Keying (PSK) or Quadrature
            Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in scenarios with significant noise or
            fading. Therefore, the choice of modulation technique should be
            based on the specific requirements and challenges of the
            communication scenario.
