      "question": "In coherent passband FSK systems, what is the most significant technical challenge that must be addressed in high-mobility wireless environments?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Maintaining precise carrier phase alignment over fast fading channels",
        "b": "Achieving orthogonal frequency separation under limited bandwidth",

        "d": "Minimizing group delay distortion"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Coherent detection requires stable phase references, which is difficult in fast-changing channels.",
        "b": "Important, but secondary to phase synchronization for coherent demodulation.",
        "c": "Envelope is constant in FSK, so this is less of a challenge.",
        "d": "Group delay matters but is not the core challenge in coherent FSK."

    {
      "questionNumber": 2,
      "question": "Why does passband ASK perform poorly in environments with multipath fading and Doppler effects?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The receiver cannot distinguish closely spaced frequencies",
        "b": "Amplitude information is highly susceptible to deep fades and phase distortion",
        "c": "Carrier frequency cannot be synchronized without Doppler tracking",
        "d": "ASK requires adaptive filtering to decode phase transitions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This would affect FSK more than ASK.",
        "b": "Correct. Multipath fading distorts amplitude, making ASK very unreliable.",

      "questionNumber": 3,
      "question": "Among passband ASK, FSK, and PSK, which is the most bandwidth-efficient under ideal channel conditions and why?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "ASK, because it encodes directly in amplitude",
        "b": "FSK, due to orthogonal frequency spacing",
        "c": "PSK, due to the possibility of higher-order phase states with minimal bandwidth expansion",
        "d": "All are equally efficient when error-correcting codes are used"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "ASK lacks spectral compactness due to abrupt transitions.",
        "b": "FSK typically consumes more bandwidth due to multiple tones.",
        "c": "Correct. PSK supports multiple bits per symbol in a narrowband.",

        "b": "It decreases SNR requirement per bit",
        "c": "It reduces symbol duration significantly",
        "d": "It reduces phase separation, increasing symbol error probability"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Spectral efficiency increases, but noise sensitivity rises.",
        "b": "It actually increases the required SNR for the same BER.",
        "c": "Symbol duration is often fixed; bits per symbol increase instead.",
        "d": "Correct. More phase states → smaller angles → more susceptible to noise."

        "c": "It uses constant power transmission, unlike coherent FSK",
        "d": "It is more robust to Doppler spread in fast fading channels"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Non-coherent detection does not improve bandwidth usage.",
        "b": "Correct. It avoids phase-locked loops, reducing receiver complexity.",
        "c": "Both coherent and non-coherent FSK maintain constant envelope.",

    {
      "questionNumber": 6,
      "question": "Why is PSK considered more power-efficient than FSK or ASK under the same bandwidth constraints in a passband system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "PSK transmits using multiple carriers simultaneously",
        "b": "PSK uses phase transitions that are less affected by amplitude noise",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This describes OFDM or CDMA, not PSK.",
        "b": "Correct. PSK’s constant envelope makes it robust to amplitude noise.",
        "c": "PSK can be bandwidth-efficient; power efficiency isn’t due to bandwidth spread.",
        "d": "All modulations need synchronization in some form."

      "questionNumber": 8,
      "question": "Why does the BER increase in higher-order passband PSK systems such as 8-PSK or 16-PSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They require greater frequency spacing between symbols",
        "b": "The symbols become closer in phase, making them harder to distinguish under noise",
        "c": "They introduce amplitude modulation into the signal",
        "d": "They require non-constant envelope detectors"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "PSK modulates phase, not frequency.",
